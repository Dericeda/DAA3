# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - MST Assignment

Get up and running in 2 minutes!

## ⚡ Super Quick Start

### For Unix/Linux/macOS:
```bash
./run.sh
```

### For Windows:
```cmd
run.bat
```

That's it! The script will:
1. ✓ Compile all files
2. ✓ Run tests (10/10 should pass)
3. ✓ Run main program
4. ✓ Generate results

---

## 📋 Manual Quick Start

### Step 1: Compile (5 seconds)
```bash
javac *.java
```

### Step 2: Run Tests (5 seconds)
```bash
java MSTTest
```

**Expected output:**
```
============================================================
Running MST Algorithm Tests
============================================================
Test 1: Both algorithms produce same total cost... ✓ PASS
Test 2: MST has V-1 edges... ✓ PASS
...
Test 10: Large graph performance... ✓ PASS

============================================================
Test Results: 10 passed, 0 failed
============================================================
```

### Step 3: Run Main Program (5 seconds)
```bash
java MSTSolver
```

**Expected output:**
- Processes graphs from `input.json`
- Shows MST edges, costs, and performance
- Generates `output_results.json`
- Displays performance comparison table

---

## 📁 What You Get

### Input
- `input.json` - Sample graphs (provided)

### Output
- `output_results.json` - Algorithm results
- Console output with performance comparison

---

## 🎯 What to Look For

### 1. Test Results
✓ All 10 tests should pass

### 2. MST Costs
✓ Both algorithms should produce **identical** costs

### 3. Performance
✓ Execution times should be < 1ms for small graphs

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "javac: command not found"
**Problem:** Java not installed  
**Solution:** Install JDK 8+ from java.com

### "Cannot find input.json"
**Problem:** Not in correct directory  
**Solution:** Navigate to project folder first

### Compilation errors
**Problem:** Java version too old  
**Solution:** Update to JDK 8 or higher

---

## 📚 Next Steps

1. ✓ **View Results**: Open `output_results.json`
2. ✓ **Read Report**: Check `ANALYTICAL_REPORT.md`
3. ✓ **Modify Input**: Edit `input.json` to test your own graphs
4. ✓ **Explore Code**: Look at algorithm implementations
